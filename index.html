      <h2>Professional</h2>
      <p>
        I love to code and learn and am currently studying Computer Science at the University at Buffalo.  Because I love to learn, I have worked on a bunch of different things in the realm of CS.  I am fairly fluent in object-oriented languages (Java and C++), functional languages (like SML), scripting languages (Python and JavaScript), and html/CSS.  I can use Windows and OSX, but Linux will always be my favorite.  I am currently working at UBâ€™s CIT help desk, learning about networking and IT.
      </p>
      <h2>Personal</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised just outside of Buffalo, NY, and I believe life is a series of experiences, so I want to experience as many things as possible.  I like trying new things, like climbing mountains, traveling, doing calisthenics, listening to music, and watching movies.
