      Spies is an online game based off of Werewolf and Mafia. The object of the game is to survive by working together with your fellow spies or civilians, and survive by killing the other team. When the game starts, each player is assigned to one of seven
      roles, and those roles stay a secret to other players. The game is split into day and night, and during the day everyone votes to kill one player. The player with the most votes at the start of the night is killed. There are many more civilians
      than spies, so if the spies are outed, they will quickly be killed. To give the spies a fighting chance, every night they can vote to kill somebody. Many of the civilians have abilities to use during the night too, such as peeking at the roles of
      other players, protecting somebody from being killed by the spies, and many more. The days and nights can be real-time, where the time of day in real life is the same as the game, or where the game automatically switches time of day when all the
      players have voted.
